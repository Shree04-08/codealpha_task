# Data Science Internship – CodeAlpha

This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science Internship with CodeAlpha.
The internship focused on practical machine learning, data analysis, and real-world applications of data science concepts.

# 🚀 Internship Tasks
## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective: Classify Iris flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using their sepal and petal measurements.

### Workflow:

Used the Iris dataset (scikit-learn / CSV version).

Applied Logistic Regression / SVM / Decision Tree for classification.

Encoded target labels and split dataset into train-test sets.

Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.

Outcome: Achieved high accuracy (>95%) in predicting flower species.

## Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

### Objective: Analyze unemployment rate trends in India, especially during Covid-19.

### Workflow:

Cleaned and processed unemployment dataset (columns: Region, Date, Frequency, Unemployment Rate (%), Employed, Labour Participation).

Converted date column into time-series format.

Performed data exploration and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Investigated seasonal and regional unemployment trends.

Outcome: Clear insights into the rise in unemployment during Covid-19 and identification of regional variations.

## Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

### Objective: Predict the selling price of used cars based on multiple features.

### Workflow:

Preprocessed dataset (features: Year, Present Price, Driven Kms, Fuel Type, Transmission, Owner).

Dropped irrelevant columns (Car_Name).

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical data.

Built regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, R² Score.

Visualized actual vs predicted prices and feature importance.

Outcome: Random Forest model performed better in predicting car prices with higher accuracy.
